#How To Start Contributing

##The BIG-LUCID Reference Wiki
Click on the tab that days wiki (near the top of this page) and click 'New Page' (upper right) begin contributing. The wiki pages are written in [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics) which reads like plain english with some special formatting syntax. Feel free to:
  * Create a page describing some of the projects you are working on/interested in
  * Create a page describing any data sets you wish to share with teh group
  * Create a page about an analysis technique you are familiar with
  * Edit &/or expand upon any pages already created

##Share Your Code
To keep things clean, we will not be adding projects directly to this repository. Instead, we will provide a links to your own github repositories under the project Links section (see above). If you are adding a link to a project, please add a page in the wiki with a brief blurb describing it to other Lucid members. If you are new to github and would like to create a repository for your projects this [tutorial](https://try.github.io/) is a great place to start.

##Share You Datasets
We are still deciding how this should be organized... stay tuned! In the meantime, please add a page to the wiki describing the data and a link to where it can be found.
